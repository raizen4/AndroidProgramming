# MyFirstApp a.k.a Realtime Currency Converter<br/>
-This was my first app since i have begun Android developing. It is a simple yet very useful realtime currency converter<br/>
-It usses the api from http://fixer.io/ to retrieve realtime data about the exchange rates<br/>
-it is simple but useful for me as i travel quite a lot and i need to make sure i can check fast the exchange rates<br/>
